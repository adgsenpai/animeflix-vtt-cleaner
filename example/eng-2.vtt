01:29.980 --> 01:33.980
<b>Minato and Mikoto</b>

01:38.450 --> 01:40.240
<b>Why don't you call him "big brother"?</b>

01:42.080 --> 01:42.830
<b>What do you mean?</b>

01:43.250 --> 01:44.670
<b>Mikoto in Class 2.</b>

01:45.170 --> 01:47.330
<b>He's your brother, right?
Why don't you call him that?</b>

01:48.170 --> 01:49.500
<b>No way!</b>

01:49.800 --> 01:50.790
<b>We're the same age.</b>

01:51.300 --> 01:54.990
<b>He's the same grade, only he was
born 11 months earlier than you.</b>

01:54.990 --> 01:57.090
<b>It doesn't change
the fact he's your big brother.</b>

01:57.550 --> 01:59.110
<b>Okay, so,</b>

01:59.110 --> 02:01.100
<b>if I call him big brother,</b>

02:01.100 --> 02:03.890
<b>then you have to call him senpai.</b>

02:03.890 --> 02:04.350
<b>What?</b>

02:04.350 --> 02:05.440
<b>Hey there!</b>

02:05.440 --> 02:06.770
<b>What are you two arguing about?</b>

02:07.100 --> 02:09.070
<b>Hurry up and come have lunch!</b>

02:09.070 --> 02:10.690
<b>Want to eat outside?</b>

02:11.020 --> 02:12.060
<b>The weather's very nice.</b>

02:12.060 --> 02:14.740
<b>That sounds good! Let's get...</b>

02:19.660 --> 02:20.280
<b>What's wrong?</b>

02:22.700 --> 02:24.710
<b>I forgot my lunch...</b>

02:25.540 --> 02:26.610
<b>Uh oh...</b>

02:26.610 --> 02:27.790
<b>That sucks...</b>

02:27.790 --> 02:28.920
<b>You'll miss out...</b>

02:31.000 --> 02:33.050
<b>You forget things pretty often...</b>

02:33.960 --> 02:35.170
<b>Yuzuki!</b>

02:35.800 --> 02:37.260
<b>Your big brother is here.</b>

02:38.550 --> 02:39.850
<b>You forgot this.</b>

02:43.060 --> 02:44.300
<b>My lunch!</b>

02:46.640 --> 02:50.560
<b>Sorry, I wanted to bring it to you earlier.</b>

02:51.690 --> 02:54.650
<b>Your brother is always so considerate.</b>

02:55.190 --> 02:57.650
<b>Aren't you going to thank him, Minato?</b>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.150
<b>I was getting to it!</b>

03:00.150 --> 03:03.660
<b>It's just, you beat me to it!</b>

03:05.500 --> 03:09.040
<b>By the way, we're going outside to eat.</b>

03:09.370 --> 03:11.080
<b>Do you want to come with us, Mikoto-paisen?</b>

03:12.880 --> 03:13.670
<b>Paisen...?</b>

03:17.840 --> 03:18.630
<b>Sure.</b>

03:20.970 --> 03:21.510
<b>Are you sure?</b>

03:24.640 --> 03:27.020
<b>I-I don't care, it's up to you!</b>

03:27.560 --> 03:29.940
<b>Great, let's go, let's go!</b>

03:35.780 --> 03:38.440
<b>Why are you so nice to Minato?</b>

03:39.820 --> 03:40.820
<b>-Pass the ball!</b>

03:40.820 --> 03:42.910
<b>He's so prickly with you.</b>

03:43.450 --> 03:45.150
<b>He doesn't call you his big brother...</b>

03:45.150 --> 03:47.080
<b>So I'm just curious.</b>

03:47.660 --> 03:49.960
<b>I'm an only child,
so I don't really get it.</b>

03:50.330 --> 03:52.080
<b>Is that just how it is between brothers?</b>

03:58.300 --> 04:01.470
<b>I didn’t like Minato this 
much in the beginning.</b>

04:03.890 --> 04:10.310
<b>I was the youngest kid
in the family for only 11 months.</b>

04:11.520 --> 04:14.770
<b>Once I started becoming aware of things,
everything was already revolving around Minato.</b>

04:18.320 --> 04:22.030
<b>Minato, you've only returned from kindergarten
for two minutes!</b>

04:22.030 --> 04:24.030
<b>Don't do that!</b>

04:25.240 --> 04:27.200
<b>Stop laughing.</b>

04:27.200 --> 04:29.370
<b>You used crayon to draw this...
It's not going to come off!</b>

04:31.540 --> 04:34.000
<b>Mikoto, mommy needs to clean this up...</b>

04:34.000 --> 04:36.550
<b>Go bring your stuff into the house.
Don't forget Minato's too.</b>

04:37.920 --> 04:38.760
<b>Okay.</b>

04:39.210 --> 04:41.170
<b>Cut it out, Minato!</b>

04:42.300 --> 04:46.010
<b>Minato was a rowdy prankster.
Our parents couldn't take their eyes off him.</b>

04:46.890 --> 04:51.110
<b>The teacher gave me full marks
on my kindergarten printout today.</b>

04:51.110 --> 04:52.940
<b>I want to show it to mom...</b>

04:53.600 --> 04:55.860
<b>But she seems busy right now.
I'll show her later.</b>

04:58.360 --> 05:01.650
<b>Minato, it'll be okay.
We'll be at the hospital soon, okay.</b>

05:02.900 --> 05:05.070
<b>I brought the car around. Let's go.</b>

05:05.660 --> 05:07.370
<b>Hayato, take care of things here, okay?</b>

05:07.780 --> 05:08.290
<b>Okay.</b>

05:19.380 --> 05:22.840
<b>Minato was born earlier than expected.</b>

05:23.260 --> 05:25.100
<b>It could have been his smaller size...</b>

05:25.100 --> 05:27.250
<b>He's usually so lively for his size...</b>

05:27.250 --> 05:31.020
<b>But he was frail and often 
sick with high fevers.</b>

05:31.520 --> 05:33.350
<b>Our parents spend all their energy on him.</b>

05:36.400 --> 05:37.810
<b>It'll be okay.</b>

05:37.810 --> 05:39.820
<b>Let's take a bath and wait for them.</b>

05:40.190 --> 05:40.690
<b>Okay.</b>

05:42.820 --> 05:44.990
<b>Mikoto, what's that you're holding?</b>

05:45.660 --> 05:47.660
<b>Oh, wow!</b>

05:47.660 --> 05:49.870
<b>You're writing now!</b>

05:50.540 --> 05:52.040
<b>It's only hiragana...</b>

05:52.580 --> 05:55.370
<b>But the other kids also know how to write...</b>

05:55.920 --> 05:58.540
<b>I don't think they're writing this nicely!</b>

05:59.210 --> 06:01.130
<b>This is nicer than my handwriting!</b>

06:01.670 --> 06:03.090
<b>You doing great, Mikoto!</b>

06:06.050 --> 06:10.120
<b>Hayato is almost twelve years older
than me and in high school.</b>

06:10.120 --> 06:13.100
<b>He wasn't home often
due to his schoolwork and clubs, but...</b>

06:13.890 --> 06:17.770
<b>he meant a lot to me at that time.</b>

06:24.440 --> 06:27.070
<b>You write so well, Mikoto!</b>

06:27.360 --> 06:28.820
<b>You're good at painting too!</b>

06:28.820 --> 06:30.870
<b>Your must be very good with your hands!</b>

06:34.620 --> 06:36.920
<b>I'll show it to mom this time...</b>

06:58.730 --> 06:59.400
<b>Minato!</b>

07:02.520 --> 07:04.190
<b>Did you do this?</b>

07:06.240 --> 07:07.400
<b>It wasn't me.</b>

07:08.160 --> 07:08.860
<b>Liar!</b>

07:10.490 --> 07:13.040
<b>Why are your hands covered in crayon?</b>

07:13.790 --> 07:16.330
<b>I wanted to show it to mom!</b>

07:19.330 --> 07:20.580
<b>Leave me alone!</b>

07:36.640 --> 07:37.520
<b>Minato!</b>

07:42.270 --> 07:43.520
<b>What happened?</b>

07:45.230 --> 07:48.200
<b>Minato! How'd you get that bump?</b>

07:48.700 --> 07:50.610
<b>Mikoto pushed me!</b>

07:51.240 --> 07:53.700
<b>Minato, why did you do that?</b>

07:53.700 --> 07:55.160
<b>Because he...</b>

07:55.830 --> 07:58.000
<b>You are his big brother,
you should know better!</b>

08:00.120 --> 08:01.960
<b>I should take him to the hospital.</b>

08:06.460 --> 08:08.720
<b>I'm...not his big brother.</b>

08:09.250 --> 08:12.260
<b>[I'm <i>not</i> his big brother]</b>

08:12.590 --> 08:13.790
<b>Welcome back, Hayato.</b>

08:13.790 --> 08:15.180
<b>Can you look after the house?</b>

08:15.720 --> 08:16.010
<b>We're the same age.</b>

08:16.010 --> 08:16.810
<b>-What's wrong?
We're the same age.</b>

08:16.810 --> 08:17.020
<b>We're the same age.</b>

08:17.020 --> 08:17.680
<b>-Minato got into a fight with Mikoto
and his head got bumped.</b>

08:17.680 --> 08:20.020
<b>We're in the same kindergarten class.
-Minato got into a fight with Mikoto
and his head got bumped.</b>

08:20.020 --> 08:20.810
<b>-Minato got into a fight with Mikoto
and his head got bumped.</b>

08:22.310 --> 08:24.730
<b>Why do I have to be his older brother?</b>

08:25.730 --> 08:29.610
<b>Why am I the one who 
always has to be patient?</b>

08:30.820 --> 08:33.620
<b>Mikoto, I heard you had a fight with Minato.</b>

08:34.030 --> 08:34.950
<b>What happened--</b>

08:34.950 --> 08:35.370
<b>-Ow!
What happened--</b>

08:35.370 --> 08:35.490
<b>What happened--</b>

08:38.410 --> 08:42.790
<b>Are you okay?
You bumped your head, huh.</b>

08:48.010 --> 08:50.510
<b>Why didn't you say you got hurt?</b>

08:57.260 --> 09:00.520
<b>Is it that painful?
Should we go to the hospital?</b>

09:01.980 --> 09:04.860
<b>I'm fine, it's not that...</b>

09:10.030 --> 09:13.280
<b>If Minato wasn't born early...</b>

09:13.950 --> 09:15.870
<b>if he was much younger than me...</b>

09:16.780 --> 09:22.660
<b>Would I be a good
big brother to him like Hayato is?</b>

09:27.670 --> 09:29.710
<b>Mikoto, wait here a moment.</b>

09:36.850 --> 09:38.800
<b>This is for you.</b>

09:40.600 --> 09:41.390
<b>A toy?</b>

09:42.020 --> 09:44.190
<b>I just got it from the supermarket.</b>

09:44.940 --> 09:46.560
<b>There's only one,
so you have to keep it a secret!</b>

09:50.150 --> 09:52.440
<b>I'm not sure what it is, 
so I want you to have it.</b>

09:55.110 --> 09:56.240
<b>Just for me?</b>

09:57.450 --> 09:59.700
<b>Yup, just for you!</b>

10:11.550 --> 10:13.670
<b>Thank you, Hayato.</b>

10:22.100 --> 10:23.100
<b>Just for me.</b>

10:45.830 --> 10:46.920
<b>What are you doing?</b>

10:48.420 --> 10:49.380
<b>Nothing.</b>

10:50.540 --> 10:52.840
<b>Liar. You just hid something!</b>

10:53.550 --> 10:54.890
<b>I did not.</b>

10:54.890 --> 10:56.010
<b>Yes, you did!</b>

10:58.220 --> 10:59.340
<b>Minato!</b>

11:02.100 --> 11:04.850
<b>Minato, come here!</b>

11:26.250 --> 11:27.210
<b>Because it's a secret.</b>

11:29.880 --> 11:31.250
<b>It's mine and mine alone.</b>

11:31.250 --> 13:03.590
<b></b>

12:03.590 --> 12:04.340
<b>Minato?</b>

12:11.140 --> 12:12.140
<b>Don't touch that!</b>

12:29.540 --> 12:32.560
<b>It's all your fault! You ran at me...</b>

12:38.840 --> 12:42.510
<b>Hayato got it just for me...</b>

12:45.550 --> 12:48.510
<b>Mom, Minato, he...!</b>

12:48.970 --> 12:50.450
<b>Mom...!</b>

12:50.970 --> 12:53.160
<b>You are his big brother,
you should know better!</b>

12:58.940 --> 12:59.820
<b>Why?</b>

13:01.530 --> 13:05.030
<b>Why do you always take the things I like...</b>

13:05.030 --> 13:07.160
<b>and take them away or destroy them...!</b>

13:12.200 --> 13:14.290
<b>I hate you!</b>

13:15.000 --> 13:18.790
<b>It would be better if you were never born!</b>

13:33.980 --> 13:36.730
<b>Minato, did Mikoto leave just now?</b>

13:39.230 --> 13:40.440
<b>What's wrong?</b>

13:52.450 --> 13:53.370
<b>See you tomorrow.</b>

14:07.430 --> 14:08.260
<b>Mikoto.</b>

14:10.470 --> 14:13.390
<b>You're still out here? Let's go home.</b>

14:16.940 --> 14:17.810
<b>I'm not going home.</b>

14:20.770 --> 14:23.610
<b>I said something really bad to Minato.</b>

14:28.360 --> 14:30.910
<b>I can't be his big brother.</b>

14:31.830 --> 14:37.870
<b>I can't treat Minato like you treat me.</b>

14:39.880 --> 14:44.250
<b>Whenever Minato takes something
important from me or destroys it...</b>

14:44.840 --> 14:47.550
<b>I always get so angry.</b>

14:48.720 --> 14:50.680
<b>Anyone would be upset.</b>

14:51.050 --> 14:54.190
<b>But you never get angry at me...</b>

14:54.190 --> 14:57.980
<b>That's because you never
do anything that makes me angry.</b>

14:57.980 --> 15:01.650
<b>I don't want to do anything
that will make you angry.</b>

15:03.070 --> 15:05.530
<b>But Minato is not like that.</b>

15:06.280 --> 15:08.280
<b>He must hate me.</b>

15:13.490 --> 15:16.750
<b>I am twelve years older than you...</b>

15:17.120 --> 15:20.250
<b>I really only think that you're a cute kid...</b>

15:21.460 --> 15:25.460
<b>Or maybe I should say, 
you're like a grandson?</b>

15:27.630 --> 15:30.430
<b>But there not much of
an age gap between you and Minato.</b>

15:30.760 --> 15:33.180
<b>So maybe you can't think of him like that...</b>

15:35.930 --> 15:39.180
<b>But he's still your little brother.</b>

15:41.190 --> 15:45.020
<b>Even if you are the same age
or your handwriting is better than his...</b>

15:45.570 --> 15:47.410
<b>You're the big brother...</b>

15:47.410 --> 15:49.920
<b>You learn everything before Minato does.</b>

15:50.610 --> 15:52.530
<b>And that might irritate Minato.</b>

15:56.160 --> 15:57.950
<b>But I'm also sure...</b>

15:58.580 --> 16:00.460
<b>it's because he admires you a lot.</b>

16:03.580 --> 16:05.210
<b>He likes you very much.</b>

16:05.710 --> 16:08.090
<b>That’s why he wants
to do everything like you...</b>

16:09.170 --> 16:10.260
<b>even if he can't,</b>

16:10.670 --> 16:11.800
<b>or doesn't know what to do...</b>

16:11.800 --> 16:13.930
<b>That's why he's like that towards you.</b>

16:17.890 --> 16:19.020
<b>Really?</b>

16:20.140 --> 16:22.690
<b>Minato wants to be like me?</b>

16:24.270 --> 16:25.190
<b>I think so.</b>

16:25.980 --> 16:27.690
<b>You said so yourself.</b>

16:28.110 --> 16:29.820
<b>You're not like me.</b>

16:39.660 --> 16:42.370
<b>Let's go home. It's time for dinner.</b>

16:44.500 --> 16:45.630
<b>Welcome back!</b>

16:46.590 --> 16:48.090
<b>Oh, and Hayato!</b>

16:48.420 --> 16:49.840
<b>Dinner is ready.</b>

16:50.710 --> 16:53.550
<b>Minato said he wasn't feeling well
and didn't want to eat.</b>

16:54.050 --> 16:55.390
<b>I hope he's okay...</b>

17:28.090 --> 17:29.090
<b>Are you alright?</b>

17:33.880 --> 17:36.550
<b>I'm sorry for saying what I did...</b>

17:46.730 --> 17:47.730
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

17:57.820 --> 18:01.370
<b>I tried everything to fix it...</b>

18:19.050 --> 18:19.720
<b>It's okay...</b>

18:33.730 --> 18:39.450
<b>If I'm as nice to him as Hayato is to me...</b>

18:58.180 --> 19:02.100
<b>Both of you got full marks.
You did so good!</b>

19:04.350 --> 19:08.560
<b>Listen! Mikoto taught me how to do it!</b>

19:11.480 --> 19:12.360
<b>Is that so?</b>

19:16.610 --> 19:18.450
<b>You're such a good big brother.</b>

19:18.450 --> 19:44.470
<b></b>

19:33.910 --> 19:35.580
<b>Becoming a big brother to him...</b>

19:36.190 --> 19:38.430
<b>I saw how cute Mikoto was.</b>

19:51.460 --> 19:53.670
<b>You asked why I'm so gentle to Minato...</b>

19:56.650 --> 19:58.060
<b>Do I even need to say it?</b>

19:59.270 --> 20:02.030
<b>It's because because he's my little brother.</b>

20:06.400 --> 20:07.880
<b>Fair enough.</b>

20:08.550 --> 20:11.940
<b>It's hard for an only child 
to understand what it's like.</b>

20:12.940 --> 20:14.190
<b>I also know...</b>

20:15.790 --> 20:18.200
<b>the more prickly he is...</b>

20:18.560 --> 20:20.950
<b>the more I know how much he likes me.</b>

20:20.950 --> 20:22.510
<b>It makes him even more cute.</b>

20:31.680 --> 20:37.090
<b>It was then that Nikaido thought of
Son Goku and the Buddha.</b>

20:40.640 --> 20:42.560
<b>Hey you guys!</b>
